# Creating Pull Requests

When creating pull requests, always follow these steps:
1. Create a new branch first
2. Make your changes and create commits
3. Push the branch to remote
4. **ALWAYS check if `.github/pull_request_template.md` exists before creating the PR**
5. Use the `gh pr create` command to create pull requests

If `.github/pull_request_template.md` exists, you MUST follow its template guidelines when creating pull requests.
