# Source Playbook

Use this playbook to prioritize reliable evidence quickly.

## Priority Order

1. Primary sources (preferred)
   - Official documentation and changelogs
   - Government and regulator pages
   - Standards/specification bodies
   - Company investor relations and pricing pages
   - Original papers and datasets
2. Secondary sources (supporting)
   - Reputable media coverage
   - Analyst summaries
   - Community discussions (only for leads, not final authority)

## Topic Mapping

- Software/API behavior: official documentation, release notes, repository tags/issues
- Pricing/subscriptions: vendor pricing page, billing docs, terms pages
- Laws/regulations: government portal, regulator guidance, official legal text
- Statistics/economics: official statistical agencies, central banks, international institutions
- Medical/science: peer-reviewed journals, public health agencies, clinical guidelines
- Travel/transport schedules: official operator schedule/status pages

## Quality Checks

For each source, check:

1. Authority: who publishes it?
2. Freshness: publication/update date?
3. Scope fit: does it match user region/timeframe?
4. Verifiability: does it contain direct data or only opinion?
5. Independence: is it repeating another source without attribution?

## Conflict Rule

When sources disagree:

1. Prefer higher-authority primary source.
2. Prefer newer source if authority is similar.
3. Report disagreement and rationale in one short note.

## Citation Rule

Always include:

- Source title or site name
- Direct link
- Concrete date (published/updated or access date when unavailable)
